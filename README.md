 ## ⚙️ How it works:

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Template Game Logic <small>(Click here for full explanation)</small></summary>

- Your goal is to move the square to collect stars and earn points.
- Each time the square touches a star, it gains a new random color.
- The square can destroy only the balls that match its current color.
- If it hits a ball of a different color, you lose a life.
- Collect as many stars as possible and survive as long as you can to achieve a high score.
